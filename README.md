## Description

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API then using that data in the context of their own. This weather dashboard application does just that as it was built using the OpenWeather One Call API. A user can enter a city then retrieve a current and future forecast for that specified city. In addition, the searched cities are persisted using local storage.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
